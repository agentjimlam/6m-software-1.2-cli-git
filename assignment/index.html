              <p>Hi, I'm Jimmy Lam, I'm an aspiring software engineer, interested in how to make cool websites and apps. I want to find out how to make cool animated 
                websites like <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en" target="_blank">Kojima Productions</a>, <a href="https://www.ilm.com/" target="_blank">Industrial Light & Magic</a>, 
                and <a href="https://www.bikebear.com.my/" target="_blank">Bike Bear Digital Agency</a>.
                My short-term goal is to become a skilled front-end developer and hit a PR of 24kg kettlebell one-arm push press, and work towards becoming a DevOps Engineer as my long-term goal.</p>
              <p>I'm a pop culture consumer by nature, fortunately or unfortunately. I'm also into roleplaying video games, Mass Effect and Dragon Age:Origin being my favourites.
                I enjoy tabletop games too. That led me down a deep rabbit hole of Dungeon & Dragons live shows on youtube, and now, I've DM'ed a few D&D sessions myself. 
                My favourite stand-up is, anything by Bill Burr. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is a comedy show I watch during my free time.</p>
